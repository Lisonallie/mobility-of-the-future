### Mobility of the Future

[Here](https://lisonallie.github.io/mobility-of-the-future/) is a demo page I made for the idea my group came up with at the [Mobility of the Future Hackathon](https://motf19.mobilityofthefuture.be). Our idea was for Sportpaleis Group in connection with how they can improve the mobility around their different events to enhance the customer experience from where it is now.

This was a two-day hackathon in Hasselt focusing mainly on the idea produced rather than the developed outcome. Nevertheless, we received tools from experts at the event to make our idea come to life.

In my demo page the user arrives at the page after booking their tickets and is prompted to personalize their ticket(s). Clicking this button opens up a map interface using the API of the company named 'Here'. This is a route planner API that can be used to show destination markers and routes with different kinds of transportation.

I programmed the set destination as Sportpaleis in Antwerp and entered an arbitrary starting point for demo purposes. The user can select from a wide option of transportation vehicles as buttons below the map including tram, train, bus, waterbus, bike, step, and car. Next to each option is the eco status of each option. The user can click each option and receive customized routes to Sportpaleis based on which method of transportation they chose.
